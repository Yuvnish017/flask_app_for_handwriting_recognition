    <h1><u>Description of the Project</u></h1>
    <p>This project is made with a motive to recognize handwritten digits and uppercase english alphabets using
    Convolutional Neural Network. The neural network was trained using combining MNIST dataset and Char74K dataset
    with some personal data making the complete dataset of around 400K images(including training set and test set).
    </p><br><br>
    <h2><u>The Project was made using</u></h2>
    <ul id="text_align_p">
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Keras</li>
        <li>Numpy</li>
        <li>Sklearn</li>
    </ul><br><br>
    <h2><u>Datasets used</u></h2>
    <ul id="text_align_d">
        <li>MNIST dataset</li>
        <li>Char74K</li>
    </ul><br><br>
    <h2><u>Architecture used for Training the Neural Network</u></h2>
    <p>Images of dataset which was fed to the neural network for training where having a shape of 32x128x1(images were
    Grayscale Images)<br>
    The architecture used for training the neural network consists of 5 Convolutional Layers with first 2 layers
    having kernel size of 5x5 with stride of 1 and padding such that layer output has same shape as input to the layer
    known as Same Convolution and the other 3 convolutional layers has kernel size of 3x3 with stride of 1 and Same
    Convolution. Each Convolution layer is followed by an Activation Layer with RELU as activation function and a Max
    Pooling layer with kernel size of 2x2 and stride of 2.<br>
    The 5th Convolutional Layer is connected to Fully Connected Layers. There are in total 3 Fully Connected layers in
    the network with first 2 layers have 120 and 84 hidden units respectively with RELU as activation function and the
    last Fully Connected layer which is last layer of network also has hidden units equal to number of classes in which
    we want to classify the input images. In this case number of classes is equal to 36. The last Fully Connected
    layer has Softmax function as its activation function.<br>
    Below is the FLow Chart of the network:-<br>
    <img src=" {{ url_for('static', filename='architecture.png' ) }}", id="flow_chart"><br>
    We achieved a training accuracy of 99.5% and 98% accuracy on test set using this network.</p><br><br>
    <h2><u>Instructions for Uploading the Image above:-</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Before uploading the image make sure the image is cropped to contain only the paper on which you have
        written.</li>
        <li>Use only white paper.</li>
        <li>Try to write with Blue or Black Sketch pen instead of Ball Point pen.</li>
        <li>Currently the model only recognizes digits and uppercase english alphabets. Lowercase English Alphabets
        and Special Characters won't be recognized.</li>
        <li>Once you upload the image you will get preview of the image uploaded in place of left grey image.</li>
        <li>Once you upload the image don't forget to click the submit button.</li>
        <li>Once you click on submit button you will the output image in place of right side grey image and you
        will find the download button also for downloading the output image.</li>
    </ul><br><br>
